TMDB Movies Box Office Prediction & Recommender

This project is an end-to-end data analysis and machine learning pipeline built on the TMDB box office dataset.

What I did in this project:
- Loaded and cleaned the movie data (titles, release date, genres, budget, revenue, popularity, etc.).
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns:
  - Distribution of movie revenues and budgets
  - Relationship between budget and revenue
  - Basic statistics for runtime, popularity and release year
- Engineered meaningful features:
  - Parsed JSON-like fields such as genres, cast, crew, production companies and countries
  - Created indicators for top genres, top actors, top directors and top production companies
  - Extracted release year/month and simple flags such as “is sequel” and “is English”
  - Applied log-transform and winsorization to stabilize budget, revenue and popularity
- Built a machine learning model to predict log-revenue using gradient boosting (LightGBM) and then an ensemble:
  - Base LightGBM model on engineered features + TF-IDF + SVD text embeddings
  - Stacking of LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost with a RidgeCV meta-learner
  - Achieved reasonable performance on log-revenue (RMSE around 2.0 and R² around 0.53 on the hold-out set)
- Trained a content-based movie recommender:
  - Combined overview, genres, keywords, cast and directors into a text representation
  - Used sentence-transformer embeddings to recommend similar movies by title or free-text query
- Generated several diagnostic plots:
  - Residual distribution and Actual vs Predicted plots for log-revenue
  - Feature importance chart for the tree-based model
  - Learning curves (train vs validation/test) to check for overfitting

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with real-world, messy movie data (including JSON-like fields and text)
- Perform feature engineering for both numeric and text information
- Build and evaluate advanced ensemble models for regression (box office prediction)
- Implement a simple but practical content-based recommendation system in Python
- Produce clear visual diagnostics that help non-technical stakeholders understand model behaviour.
